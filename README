It is hard to adjust to command/insert mode.  
If you don't pay attention, all that typing is lost, etc.
These lines are added to your resource file _gvimrc
and will change the background color when you
go into insert mode (not every key, but the main
ones i,s,a,and o.)  The color changes back when
you press escape.
Very helpful for newbies!
